 ## Flask Application Design for FHIR APIs

### HTML Files

#### `index.html`
- This is the main HTML file that serves as the entry point for the application.
- It should contain the necessary HTML elements and placeholders to display the FHIR resources.

#### `resource.html`
- This HTML file is used to display a single FHIR resource.
- It should include the necessary HTML elements to display the resource's details.

### Routes

#### `/`
- This route handles the root URL of the application and should redirect to the `index.html` file.

#### `/fhir/Patient`
- This route handles requests for Patient resources.
- It should return a JSON representation of all the Patient resources in the database.

#### `/fhir/Patient/<patient_id>`
- This route handles requests for a specific Patient resource.
- It should return a JSON representation of the Patient resource with the specified ID.

#### `/fhir/Observation`
- This route handles requests for Observation resources.
- It should return a JSON representation of all the Observation resources in the database.

#### `/fhir/Observation/<observation_id>`
- This route handles requests for a specific Observation resource.
- It should return a JSON representation of the Observation resource with the specified ID.

### Additional Considerations

- The application should use a database to store the FHIR resources.
- The application should implement appropriate security measures to protect the FHIR resources.
- The application should be tested thoroughly to ensure that it works as expected.
